# ProcInfo4Net

ProcInfo4Net uses [Microsoft.Diagnostics.Runtime](https://github.com/Microsoft/clrmd) for getting info about running .NET process: StackFrame for all threads, loaded modules and application domains. It might be helpful for understanding strange behaviour of running application (for example, to sort out with deadlocks)
